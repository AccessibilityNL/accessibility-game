# Accessibility Game

> Build by Bas de Bruin
> for Stichting Accessibility

> Maintained by Veron Wormeester and Bas de Bruin

## Getting started with development:
I recommend downloading Visual Studio Code and running and editing the code from there

## Setup
When first opening the project run the `first-time` script in the lower left corner in VS Code or run `npm install` from the terminal.


NPM version `14` was used during development, problems may arrise when using newer versions.
My recommendation is to use the `nvm` package to manage your NPM versions.

## Making changes
To view your changes live in the browser run the `start` script.
Open your webbrowser and go to: `http://localhost:8080` to view it.
